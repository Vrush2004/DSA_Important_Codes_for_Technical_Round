# Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
# Output: true
# Explanation: One way to obtain s3 is:
# Split s1 into s1 = "aa" + "bc" + "c", and s2 into s2 = "dbbc" + "a".
# Interleaving the two splits, we get "aa" + "dbbc" + "bc" + "a" + "c" = "aadbbcbcac".
# Since s3 can be obtained by interleaving s1 and s2, we return true.
